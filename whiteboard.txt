Log: 
- 7/7/23: More research, decided not to use DaisyUI for slideshow -- CSS options on Figma instead
- 7/10/23: Text to Met.js, update favicon and page title
- 7/13/23: Add Tailwind, DaisyUI; need to look up how to get background colors, images working
- August: updating the Met's page
- 8/31/23: finish Manuscripts.js, make button height responsive
- 9/1/23: Followed tutorial and added Carousel.js and CarouselData.js to test basic Carousel construction, next step: transfrom it using-- https://reactjsexample.com/easy-to-use-responsive-and-customizable-carousel-component-for-react/ -- but figure out a way to include links -- use TailwindElements sample with link

NOTE: fix the link action for Splash.js buttons -- add useEffect etc to go to the top of the next page. Fixed 9/18/23

package.json NOTE
- added "react-icons": "^4.10.1", "react-router-dom": "^6.14.1" for 1st carousel test
