Log: 
- 7/7/23: More research, decided not to use DaisyUI for slideshow -- CSS options on Figma instead
- 7/10/23: Text to Met.js, update favicon and page title
- 7/13/23: Add Tailwind, DaisyUI; need to look up how to get background colors, images working

NOTES: 
- don't forget to check responsive design -- may need to alter index.html
